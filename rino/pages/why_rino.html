            <h1>Why Choose Rino.js for Your Website?</h1>
            <p>
                Web app technology has revolutionized the way we build online experiences, offering powerful tools and frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>However</b>, popular frameworks like Angular, React, Next.js, Vue, and Nuxt often come with significant drawbacks. These include higher costs for hosting, traffic management, and maintenance, as well as slower build speeds and increased computing resource requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, these technologies introduce their own complex rules and learning curves. Developers must invest substantial time mastering these frameworks, adapting to their updates, and maintaining compatibility—all of which can slow down project completion.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where <b>Rino.js</b> shines. Built with simplicity in mind, it leverages standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to streamline development.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Rino.js, you can easily create websites using HTML components, integrate npm packages, and build libraries for JavaScript and CSS. It also includes tools for sitemap generation and image compression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any developer familiar with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can start building with Rino.js in just 30 minutes. For a quick introduction, check out the <a href="/project_structure.html">Project Structure</a> guide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rino.js avoids unnecessary complexity. For instance, earlier versions had a custom file format, but this was removed because simplicity is key.
            </p>
            <p>
                What’s even more impressive is that Rino.js is flexible. If you need to, you can still integrate frameworks like React or Vue. Use them only when necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, Rino.js offers an efficient alternative to heavy frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, and Nuxt. It’s a practical, straightforward solution for your web development needs.
