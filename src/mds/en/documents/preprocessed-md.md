# @md

## Markdown for preprocessing

```
some html content...
{{ @md, ./src/mds/somecontent.md }}
some html content...
```

Markdown is really good when you write a content. And you can use this feature to create something that is reusable. Such as, code blocks instead of writing them with entities.
