# Rino.js

## Fast learning, preprocessing, intuitive web framework

```
npm create rino@latest
```

Or

```
npm i rinojs rinokit
```

### Easy

Just common learnings that front-end developers do. Standard HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.js and preprocessing system. We don't need to waste our time and it just works.

### Performant

No virtual dom, smaller files, reusable components with full control over the pages. Standard SEO, standard web setup, no more problems with static site generation

### Freedom

Use libraries you like. Manage your important state in local storage. And store the others in variables. Create and use what you like.
